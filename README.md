Running the API

This app is using the django web framework with django rest frameworks. It provides 2 enpoint which can be access from a web page
on http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ships 
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/positions/?imo_number=963217

I didnt get round to ordering the responses and the tests are incomplete.
